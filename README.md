You can find out more about the course at https://kimjruhl.com/data-analytics-2019f-econ-690. The class is perpetually a work in progress. Any comments or suggestions would be much appreciated.

Currently, I am using this repo as a place to put notebooks so they can be viewed on the web. I hope to transition to a better system in the future.
